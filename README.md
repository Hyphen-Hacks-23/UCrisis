# Inspiration
We saw a lack of cohesion between public safety and communication. In a day and age where technology and internet communication is so prevalent, there is still a distinct divide between incidence reporting and public awareness. Our inspiration was helping the public stay safe and be aware and involved within their community.

# What it does
Crisis Mapper alerts users of incidence reports in their area. Given a user's location, they are provided a map of media reports in their area regarding safety, public affairs, and more. Through Crisis Matters, users are able to see the report's source, descriptions, and recency. They can explore areas across the world and search through individual reports.

# How we built it
We utilized Tkinter (a Python framework) for front end development, and Facebook-scraping, open-ai, CSV, and Pandas for backend. We start with an open map, send over users' location (by input), search through our database, identify key issues/reports, and plot this information on the map for the user to interact with.

# What we learned
We learned to utilize CSVs to communicate between different scripts.
